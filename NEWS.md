## wormbase 0.2.0 (2018-03-04)

Renamed package to `wormbase` from `worminfo`. Simplified core functionality to simply pull genome annotations from the WormBase website into R. Previous functionality querying the ENSEMBL, PANTHER, and EggNOG databases will be split out into organism-agnostic packages. RNAi clone support is being migrated to the rnaiscreen package.
