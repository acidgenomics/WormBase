## wormbase 0.2.6 (2019-03-23)

### Minor changes

- Migrated code to [Acid Genomics][].



## wormbase 0.2.5 (2019-03-19)

- Reworked progress bar handling via `pbapply::pblapply`. This is now disabled
  for all functions by default, but can be enabled with `progress = TRUE`.
  pbapply package is now declared in "Enhances:" rather than "Imports:".
- Switched all internal assert checks to goalie package from assertive.



## wormbase 0.2.4 (2018-11-21)

- Maintenance release updating the package to require R 3.5.
- Improved documentation for functions and rebuild pkgdown website.
- Added `progress = TRUE` option for functions that can take a long time to
  parse data. Previously, this was always enabled but now can be disabled
  using this `progress = FALSE`. Note that `invisible(capture.output(x))` also
  works to suppress progress bars.



## wormbase 0.2.3 (2018-07-21)

- Fixed `geneID()` function to work with latest WormBase release that now
  returns an extra biotype column.
- Removed internal parallel `mclapply()` calls in favor of `pblapply()` for
  better compatibility across platforms.



## wormbase 0.2.2 (2018-04-23)

- Broke out assertive imports into separate packages: assertive.properties,
  assertive.strings, assertive.types.
- Removed TODO comment in `description.R` file.



## wormbase 0.2.1 (2018-04-18)

- Renamed `gene` column to `geneID` where applicable.
- Removed fs package dependency.
- Added progress bars for functions that take a long time to load.



## wormbase 0.2.0 (2018-03-04)

- Renamed package to `wormbase` from `worminfo`.
- Simplified core functionality to simply pull genome annotations from the
  WormBase website into R.
- Previous functionality querying the ENSEMBL, PANTHER, and EggNOG databases
  will be split out into organism-agnostic packages.
- RNAi clone support is being migrated to the rnaiscreen package.
